### About the Game
Kizingiti: Huru Escape is a Pan-African critical thinking game designed to prevent and counter violent extremism (P/CVE). The game's name is inspired by Swahili, where "Kizingiti" means *threshold* and "Huru" means *free*.

In the game, players are challenged to use critical thinking and wisdom to escape a digital recruiter's manipulative tactics. Each correct answer helps them cross the threshold to freedom.

### Features
- A simple, engaging quiz-style gameplay.
- Questions designed to build critical thinking skills.
- No personal data is collected or stored on a server. All session results are saved locally in your browser.

### How to Play
1. Enter your name and a session code (for group play).
2. Choose your game mode (Pre-Webinar or Post-Webinar).
3. Answer the questions correctly to unlock the door and escape. You have three heartsâ€”each wrong answer costs you a heart.
